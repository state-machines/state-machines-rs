## About This Project

This is a Rust port of the popular [state_machines](https://github.com/state-machines/state_machines) Ruby gem, created as a **learning platform for Rubyists transitioning to Rust**.

While learning Rust, I chose to port something familiar and widely used—so I could compare implementations side-by-side and understand Rust's patterns through a lens I already knew. This library is intentionally **over-commented**, not because the code is disorganized, but because it's designed to be a **teaching tool**. The goal is elegant, idiomatic Rust code that Rubyists can learn from without the usual compile-pray-repeat cycle.

### Philosophy

- **Learning Ground First**: Extensive inline comments explain Rust concepts, ownership, trait bounds, and macro magic
- **Ruby Parallels**: Familiar DSL syntax and callbacks make the transition smoother
- **Production Ready**: Despite the educational focus, this is a fully functional state machine library with:
  - **Typestate pattern** for compile-time state safety
  - **Zero-cost abstractions** using PhantomData
  - Guards and unless conditions
  - Before/after event callbacks
  - Sync and async support
  - `no_std` compatibility (for embedded systems)
  - Payload support for event data
  - Move semantics preventing invalid state transitions

### For the Rust Community

**You're welcome to open PRs** to fix fundamentally wrong Rust concepts—but please **don't remove comments just because "we know it"**. This codebase serves beginners. If something can be explained better, improve the comment. If a pattern is unidiomatic, fix it *and document why*.

## Features

✅ **Typestate Pattern** – Compile-time state safety using Rust's type system with zero runtime overhead

✅ **Guards & Unless** – Conditional transitions at event and transition levels

✅ **Callbacks** – `before`/`after` hooks at event level

✅ **Async Support** – First-class `async`/`await` for guards and callbacks

✅ **Event Payloads** – Pass data through transitions with type-safe payloads

✅ **No-std Compatible** – Works on embedded targets (ESP32, bare metal)

✅ **Type-safe** – Invalid transitions become compile errors, not runtime errors

✅ **Hierarchical States** – Superstates with polymorphic transitions via SubstateOf trait

🚧 **Around Callbacks** – Planned for future release

🚧 **Dynamic Dispatch** – Event-driven mode planned (see `docs/dual_mode_design.md`)

---

## Quick Start

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
state-machines = "0.1"
```

### Basic Example

```rust
use state_machines::state_machine;

// Define your state machine
state_machine! {
    name: TrafficLight,

    initial: Red,
    states: [Red, Yellow, Green],
    events {
        next {
            transition: { from: Red, to: Green }
            transition: { from: Green, to: Yellow }
            transition: { from: Yellow, to: Red }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Typestate pattern: each transition returns a new typed machine
    let light = TrafficLight::new(());
    // Type is TrafficLight<Red>

    let light = light.next().unwrap();
    // Type is TrafficLight<Green>

    let light = light.next().unwrap();
    // Type is TrafficLight<Yellow>
}
```

### With Guards and Callbacks

```rust
use state_machines::{state_machine, core::GuardError};
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};

static DOOR_OBSTRUCTED: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

state_machine! {
    name: Door,

    initial: Closed,
    states: [Closed, Open],
    events {
        open {
            guards: [path_clear],
            before: [check_safety],
            after: [log_opened],
            transition: { from: Closed, to: Open }
        }
        close {
            transition: { from: Open, to: Closed }
        }
    }
}

impl<C, S> Door<C, S> {
    fn path_clear(&self, _ctx: &C) -> bool {
        !DOOR_OBSTRUCTED.load(Ordering::Relaxed)
    }

    fn check_safety(&self) {
        println!("Checking if path is clear...");
    }

    fn log_opened(&self) {
        println!("Door opened at {:?}", std::time::SystemTime::now());
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Successful transition
    let door = Door::new(());
    let door = door.open().unwrap();
    let door = door.close().unwrap();

    // Failed guard check
    DOOR_OBSTRUCTED.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);
    let err = door.open().expect_err("should fail when obstructed");
    let (_door, guard_err) = err;
    assert_eq!(guard_err.guard, "path_clear");
}
```

### Async Support

The typestate pattern works seamlessly with async Rust:

```rust,ignore
use state_machines::state_machine;

state_machine! {
    name: HttpRequest,

    initial: Idle,
    async: true,
    states: [Idle, Pending, Success, Failed],
    events {
        send {
            guards: [has_network],
            transition: { from: Idle, to: Pending }
        }
        succeed {
            transition: { from: Pending, to: Success }
        }
        fail {
            transition: { from: Pending, to: Failed }
        }
    }
}

impl<C, S> HttpRequest<C, S> {
    async fn has_network(&self, _ctx: &C) -> bool {
        // Async guard checks network availability
        tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_millis(10)).await;
        true
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Type: HttpRequest<Idle>
    let request = HttpRequest::new(());

    // Type: HttpRequest<Pending>
    let request = request.send().await.unwrap();

    // Type: HttpRequest<Success>
    let request = request.succeed().await.unwrap();
}
```

### Event Payloads

```rust
use state_machines::state_machine;

#[derive(Clone)]
struct LoginCredentials {
    username: String,
    password: String,
}

state_machine! {
    name: AuthSession,
    initial: LoggedOut,
    states: [LoggedOut, LoggedIn, Locked],
    events {
        login {
            payload: LoginCredentials,
            guards: [valid_credentials],
            transition: { from: LoggedOut, to: LoggedIn }
        }
        logout {
            transition: { from: LoggedIn, to: LoggedOut }
        }
    }
}

impl<C, S> AuthSession<C, S> {
    fn valid_credentials(&self, _ctx: &C, creds: &LoginCredentials) -> bool {
        // Guard receives context and payload reference
        creds.username == "admin" && creds.password == "secret"
    }
}

fn main() {
    let session = AuthSession::new(());
    // Type is AuthSession<(), LoggedOut>

    let good_creds = LoginCredentials {
        username: "admin".to_string(),
        password: "secret".to_string(),
    };

    let session = session.login(good_creds).unwrap();
    // Type is AuthSession<LoggedIn>
}
```

### Hierarchical States (Superstates)

Group related states into superstates for polymorphic transitions and cleaner state organization:

```rust
use state_machines::state_machine;

#[derive(Default, Debug, Clone)]
struct PrepData {
    checklist_complete: bool,
}

#[derive(Default, Debug, Clone)]
struct LaunchData {
    engines_ignited: bool,
}

state_machine! {
    name: LaunchSequence,

    initial: Standby,
    states: [
        Standby,
        superstate Flight {
            state LaunchPrep(PrepData),
            state Launching(LaunchData),
        },
        InOrbit,
    ],
    events {
        enter_flight {
            transition: { from: Standby, to: Flight }
        }
        ignite {
            transition: { from: Standby, to: LaunchPrep }
        }
        cycle_engines {
            transition: { from: LaunchPrep, to: Launching }
        }
        ascend {
            transition: { from: Flight, to: InOrbit }
        }
        abort {
            transition: { from: Flight, to: Standby }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Start in Standby
    let sequence = LaunchSequence::new(());

    // Transition to Flight superstate resolves to initial child (LaunchPrep)
    let sequence = sequence.enter_flight().unwrap();

    // Access state-specific data (guaranteed non-None)
    let prep_data = sequence.launch_prep_data();
    println!("Checklist complete: {}", prep_data.checklist_complete);

    // Move to Launching within Flight superstate
    let sequence = sequence.cycle_engines().unwrap();

    // abort() is defined on Flight, but works from ANY substate
    let sequence = sequence.abort().unwrap();
    // Type: LaunchSequence<C, Standby>

    // Go directly to LaunchPrep (bypassing superstate entry)
    let sequence = sequence.ignite().unwrap();
    // Type: LaunchSequence<C, LaunchPrep>

    // abort() STILL works - polymorphic transition!
    let _sequence = sequence.abort().unwrap();
}
```

**Key Features:**

- **Polymorphic Transitions**: Define transitions `from: Flight` that work from ANY substate (LaunchPrep, Launching)
- **Automatic Resolution**: `to: Flight` transitions resolve to the superstate's initial child state
- **State Data Storage**: Each state with data gets guaranteed accessors like `launch_prep_data()` and `launching_data()`
- **SubstateOf Trait**: Generated trait implementations enable compile-time polymorphism
- **Storage Lifecycle**: State data is automatically initialized on entry, cleared on exit

**Under the Hood:**

The macro generates:

```rust,ignore
// Marker trait for polymorphism
impl SubstateOf<Flight> for LaunchPrep {}
impl SubstateOf<Flight> for Launching {}

// Polymorphic transition implementation
impl<C, S: SubstateOf<Flight>> LaunchSequence<C, S> {
    pub fn abort(self) -> Result<LaunchSequence<C, Standby>, ...> {
        // Works from ANY state where S implements SubstateOf<Flight>
    }
}

// State-specific data accessors (no Option wrapper!)
impl<C> LaunchSequence<C, LaunchPrep> {
    pub fn launch_prep_data(&self) -> &PrepData { ... }
    pub fn launch_prep_data_mut(&mut self) -> &mut PrepData { ... }
}
```

**Ruby Comparison:**

Ruby's `state_machines` doesn't have formal superstate support in this way. The closest equivalent would be using state predicates:

```ruby
# Ruby approach
def in_flight?
  [:launch_prep, :launching].include?(state)
end

# Rust: Compile-time polymorphism via trait bounds
impl<C, S: SubstateOf<Flight>> LaunchSequence<C, S> {
  pub fn abort(self) -> ... { }
}
```

Rust's typestate pattern makes this compile-time safe with zero runtime overhead.

## Comparison to Ruby's state_machines

If you're coming from Ruby, here's how the concepts map:

### Ruby
```ruby
class Vehicle
  state_machine :state, initial: :parked do
    event :ignite do
      transition parked: :idling
    end

    before_transition parked: :idling, do: :check_fuel
  end

  def check_fuel
    puts "Checking fuel..."
  end
end

# Usage
vehicle = Vehicle.new
vehicle.ignite  # Mutates vehicle in place
```

### Rust (Typestate)
```rust
use state_machines::state_machine;

state_machine! {
    name: Vehicle,

    initial: Parked,
    states: [Parked, Idling],
    events {
        ignite {
            before: [check_fuel],
            transition: { from: Parked, to: Idling }
        }
    }
}

impl<C, S> Vehicle<C, S> {
    fn check_fuel(&self) {
        println!("Checking fuel...");
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Type: Vehicle<Parked>
    let vehicle = Vehicle::new(());

    // Type: Vehicle<Idling>
    let vehicle = vehicle.ignite().unwrap();
}
```

**Key Differences:**
- **Typestate pattern**: Each state is encoded in the type system (`Vehicle<Parked>` vs `Vehicle<Idling>`)
- **Move semantics**: Transitions consume the old state and return a new one
- **Compile-time validation**: Can't call `ignite()` twice - second call won't compile!
- **Zero overhead**: PhantomData optimizes away completely
- **Explicit errors**: Guards return `Result<Machine<NewState>, (Machine<OldState>, GuardError)>`
- **No mutation**: Callbacks take `&self`, not `&mut self` (machine is consumed by transition)

---

## `no_std` Support

Works on embedded targets like ESP32:

```rust,ignore
#![no_std]

use state_machines::state_machine;

state_machine! {
    name: LedController,

    initial: Off,
    states: [Off, On, Blinking],
    events {
        toggle { transition: { from: Off, to: On } }
        blink { transition: { from: On, to: Blinking } }
    }
}

fn embedded_main() {
    // Type: LedController<Off>
    let led = LedController::new(());

    // Type: LedController<On>
    let led = led.toggle().unwrap();

    // Type: LedController<Blinking>
    let led = led.blink().unwrap();

    // Wire up to GPIO pins...
}
# fn main() {} // For doctest
```

- Disable default features: `state-machines = { version = "0.1", default-features = false }`
- The library uses no allocator - purely stack-based with zero-sized state markers
- CI runs `cargo build --no-default-features` to prevent std regressions
- See `examples/no_std_flight/` for a complete embedded example

## Documentation

- **[API Docs](https://docs.rs/state-machines)** – Full API reference
- **[Migration Notes](docs/migration_notes.md)** – Compatibility guidance for pre-hierarchy adopters

---

## Migration Notes (High Level)

- Existing flat machines continue to compile unchanged; the macro infers leaf states exactly as before.
- New superstate syntax only adds enum variants—no generated method signatures were removed.
- Enable the `std` feature (default) if you rely on `std` types in guards/actions; disable it for embedded builds.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This is a learning project, so:

1. **Keep comments** – Explain *why*, not just *what*
2. **Show Rust idioms** – If something is unidiomatic, fix it *and document the correct pattern*
3. **Test thoroughly** – All tests must pass (`cargo test --workspace`)
4. **Compare to Ruby** – If you're changing behavior, note how it differs from the Ruby gem
